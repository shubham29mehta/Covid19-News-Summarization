brexit countdown clock on the white cliffs of dover which ended in the historic announcement the uk has left the eu a light show illuminated downing street when the clock struck 11pm with a mixture of celebration and regret across britain on a landmark day in a video message released to mark brexit prime minister boris johnson referenced the divisions that have been caused by the leave vote he said that while brexit represented an astonishing moment of hope for many there will be others who feel a sense of anxiety and loss but he predicted that the opportunity of brexit can be turned into a stunning success the pm hosted a reception in number 10 for cabinet ministers advisers and civil servants officials who were involved in the negotiations and supporters of the leave campaign supporters and opponents of brexit made their views known throughout britain with westminster a particular focus for events hundreds of brexit supporters gathered for a party led by nigel farage on parliament square addressing the crowd mr farage said brexit was the greatest moment in the modern history of our great nation speaking to sky news the brexit party leader said people laughed at him for trying to get the uk out of the eu but they are not laughing any more we are better bigger stronger than being a star on somebody else flag he added a recording of bongs from big ben was played out through speakers when the clock struck 11pm this was followed by a rendition of the national anthem with the lyrics displayed on a large screen above the stage earlier pro eu demonstrators took part in a procession through whitehall a crowd also gathered across the road from number 10 waving eu flags and anti brexit placards the message we still love eu was beamed onto the white cliffs of

good as membership german chancellor angela merkel said brexit was a deep break for us all and warned the negotiations will certainly not be easy meanwhile french president emmanuel macron said brexit was an alarm signal for the eu and hit out at the lies exaggerations simplifications that led to the leave vote the vote for brexit caused a political earthquake with british politics consumed by the aftershocks for years it ended the premierships of david cameron who called the referendum and theresa may who saw her time in downing street ended by the brexit chaos mr johnson who led the campaign to leave the eu managed to get a brexit deal passed by parliament he gambled on a snap election and was returned to power with a commanding majority but although a page has been turned in the process

continues to jump every day one measure to cope with the outbreak in the province where it started building three makeshift hospitals has been criticised as too little too late hundreds of workers were mobilised last week to build the facilities which are modelled on the xiaotangshan hospital built in beijing in 2003 to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome patients the temporary hospitals two in the outbreak epicentre of wuhan and one in ezhou both of which are in hubei province are part of efforts to contain the pneumonia like illness and will provide much needed hospital beds where patients can be treated in isolation they were expected to be completed in a week to 10 days and live streams from the construction sites in wuhan have drawn millions of viewers other measures include imposing a lockdown on more than a dozen hubei cities including wuhan the virus has killed 213 people and sickened more than 9 800 in china so far with dozens more cases confirmed elsewhere the world health organisation has declared it a global public health emergency chan wai keung a lecturer in social sciences at hong kong polytechnic university said the makeshift facilities in hubei were not enough building the xiaotangshan hospitals now is too little too late chan said but it is better than none concerns have been raised that the fit out and equipment at the temporary hospitals could be substandard photo reuters more he said hospitals specialising in infectious diseases should be built in various locations around china so that they are in place before outbreaks happen and can be put into use immediately to treat patients and contain the spread of a virus chan said there were also concerns that the fit out and equipment at the temporary hospitals could be substandard given the speed at which they were being built the two new facilities in wuhan will provide another 2 300 beds and are expected to be ready next week they have been given names derived from feng shui that aim to show a determination to fight the outbreak huoshenshan meaning mountain of the god of fire and leishenshan meaning mountain of the god of thunder according to state run global times in ezhou the temporary hospital is expected to be completed in 10 days and will add 600 beds according to the hubei government but the growing number of confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases will stretch both the existing and new hospital capacity to the limit as of friday hubei province had 5 806 confirmed cases up by 1 220 from the previous day there were 32 340 people under medical observation according to the hubei health commission italy declares state of emergency after two coronavirus cases confirmed the number of new cases in the province went up by an average 846 cases every day between january 25 and 30 for wuhan the average daily increase was 344 cases in that period the health commission on thursday said around 11 000 hospital beds had been made available for patients in isolation around the province and more would be added as needed as with the xiaotangshan hospital in beijing during sars the two facilities in wuhan will be managed by the military despite the scepticism over the rapidly built hospitals a source familiar with the people s liberation army medical team deployment said they would be run to a high standard she said most of the medics from the central military hospital had been deployed to hubei and some had been sent to xiaotangshan in beijing the sars era facility is to be refitted and put into use again the military run hospitals would have sufficient supplies such as protective gear for medical workers and the infectious disease doctors staffing them were well trained to prevent cross infections according to the source the military medics have sworn to dedicate themselves to treat the injured and heal the sick and battle on in the face of hardship and death the source said china goes global in search for protective suits masks and goggles story continues zhang yanling former president of the xiaotangshan hospital in beijing arrived in wuhan on saturday to provide guidance as the two new facilities in the city were being built state broadcaster cctv reported that 99 per cent of the patients admitted to the beijing facility during the sars outbreak recovered and none of the more than 1 300 medical staff were infected similar facilities are also under construction in heilongjiang and henan provinces guangdong was preparing to potentially build temporary hospitals in guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai and other cities the province s
